# Photo Quick Sorter
<!-- ## Description -->
[DEV] still dev

uses CMake, wxWidgets, and other small stuff

the goal is to make a simple (as in design aspects and complexity), lightweight (as in size and dependencies) quick photo sorter for Windows (possibly Android/Apple too)

despite the lesser popularity of using C++/CMake/wxWidgets, still fun

also to actually learn more on github stuff I'm interested in like issues, templates, and more


## How to run [DEV]

idk

CMake Tools on VSCode is currently used to build it.

once built, run `Debug\PhotoQuickSorter.exe`
